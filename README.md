# Portfolio

## Description

This webpage will serve as my portfolio and online Résumé / Curriculum vitae

I will be adding to this page examples of the work that I have completed, with links to the functional sites.

This is an improvment over my original Portfolio page as this now uses **"Bootstrap"**

The deployed application can be found on GitHub Pages at:
